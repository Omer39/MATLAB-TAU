# MATLAB-TAU
This repository includes MATLAB codes and lecture materials I used in a MATLAB Bootcamp for Turkish-German University students.

The first lecture introduces the MATLAB environment and image manipulations (cropping, colour converting etc.) Also, the ice melting level between 1980-2011 in the Iceberg is calculated by using satellite images. (The example is from MATLAB tutorials. See the codes for the link.)

The second lecture introduces nested for loops and if conditions and also mean and median image filters. These used to remove salt and paper noise. Then, we convert the code to a function.
